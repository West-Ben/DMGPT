# Backend README

This directory contains the backend code for the my-fastapi-react-app project.

## Files

- `app/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `app` directory as a Python package.
- `app/main.py`: This file creates an instance of the FastAPI app and sets up middleware and routes. It also imports the routes from the `routes` directory.
- `app/models/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `models` directory as a Python package.
- `app/routes/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `routes` directory as a Python package.
- `app/routes/items.py`: This file exports a router instance that handles the `/items` route. It imports the `Item` model from the `schemas` directory.
- `app/schemas/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `schemas` directory as a Python package.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies for the project.

## Setup

To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.7 or later.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`.
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `env\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.

The server should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

## API

The backend provides the following API:

- `GET /items`: Returns a list of items.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
pytest
```

## Deployment

To deploy the backend, follow these steps:

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your database.
2. Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to a secret key.
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Start the server: `uvicorn app.main:app`.

Note that this is just a basic setup and you may need to configure additional settings for your specific deployment environment.
